Languages
---------
Python 3

Libraries
---------
This metrifier uses both the NLTK and CLTK python libraries, both of which can be installed using pip.
The code also uses a modified copy of CLTK's scanner which represses logger output, which would otherwise be overwhelming due to some sort of bug in the original code.

Other Tools
-----------
Johan Winge's macronizer is highly recommended for users who do not wish to macronize their input by hand.

Running the Code
----------------
To run the code, run main.py and follow the command-line prompts that appear.
By default, the program is set to use the included corpus "hendecasyllabics.txt", 530 lines of machine-macronized hendecasyllabic meter from Catullus, whenever a corpus is required.  However, you may enter an alternative text file if you prefer.
All of the code's functions expect macronized input, and will attempt to match it to hendecasyllabic meter.
